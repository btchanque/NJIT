			  <summary>What is a Bank level security? </summary>
				<span>"Bank–level” security means we adhere to the same security encryption standards as your bank. We routinely run security audits to ensure we meet these standards at all times. On top of internal audits, VeriSign, McAfee and TRUSTe – the internet’s leading online security firms – validate our security.
<br />
We also physically protect the servers we store your information on. To access our servers, you would first have to bypass round–the–clock guards, then bypass doors with electronic lock systems. The servers themselves are locked behind protective cases and are monitored 24/7 by surveillance cameras. If someone were able to get past all that security and break into a server, they would then have to crack several layers of authentication and military grade 256–bit encryption to access any data.</span>

			  <summary>Am I putting my security at risk by briging all my accounts in one place?<a href="#top">[Top]</a></summary>
				<span>If someone were to steal your MOG credentials, they would be incapable of inflicting financial harm. For starters, all sensitive information is hidden so no one (not even you) can see account names or numbers. In addition, this version of MOG is read—only, so no can move money or make trades. <br />
Also, we don't ask for your full name, address, or other personally identifiable info, so there's little to no risk of identity theft or account fraud.</span>
			</details> <br />

			<details>
			  <summary>What do I have to enter my brokerage credentials to use MOG?<a href="#top">[Top]</a></summary>
				<span>Your brokerage credentials are needed to form a secure connection between SigFig and your brokerage. This allows us to import your financial information and instantly build your portfolio. This one–time process is completely secure and no one – including our own employees – can see your login credentials.</span>
			</details> <br />
            
            <details>
			  <summary>Can MOG employees see my credentials or access my brokerage and personal accounts? <a href="#top">[Top]</a></summary>
				<span>
No one – not even MOG employees – can see your account information (like account numbers or login information) or access your brokerage account(s) at any time.</span>
			</details> <br />
            
            <details>
			  <summary>Can anyone else trade or move money through MOG? <a href="#top">[Top]</a></summary>
				<span>The data gathered during this process is “read–only” which means you can look at your holdings – but you can’t touch them – so no one can ever trade or move money.</span>
			</details> <br />
            
            <details>
			  <summary>Do you sell my personal information?<a href="#top">[Top]</a></summary>
				<span>We do not — nor will we ever — sell your personal information. Earning and maintaining your trust is our highest priority and there’s no quicker way to lose that trust than by selling your information (as many free sites often do).</span>
			</details> <br />
            
            <details>
			  <summary>I have some more questions about your security, who can I speak to? <a href="#top">[Top]</a></summary>
				<span>If you have more questions about our security, send us an e–mail at support@moneyonthego.com. We’d be happy to talk with you more about our security practices and protocols.</span>
